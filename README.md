# Final-Weather-App
This is my first time building out a weather app using an outside API. I used open weather map's API to find the weather for Brentwood, TN. I was also able to figure out how to use geolocation that is built into JavaScript but not part of this project.

## Lessons Learned
I used helper functions for the first time to have more streamlined code. This took some trial and error but will be using these more in the future. 

Made and used templates in my html and used attribute selectors with my JavaScript. 

The parse current weather function in all honesty I still don't fully understand but spent a lot of time googling and reading stack overflow. I had a lot of trial and error and while it works I am still working through the why. Functionality is important, understand is crucial. 

This did take me much longer than two hours. But I am a fiercely persistent learner and while this was a bit over my capacity I learned invaluable lessons. Look forward to building out more weather apps until I fully grasp each concept.

Thank you for the challenge and look forward to more future growth.
